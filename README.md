# Text Editor
There's a gazillion options for text editors out there and i was not able to choose one for programming everyday and for making text files so I did what any sane person would do and made my own text editor.
It's called "Text Editor", amazing name I know.
Anyways it's written completely in C and has enough functionality in it for me to daily drive and it does everything I want.
